Setting up a printer in pi-topOS and Raspbian Jessie
####################################################

The following instructions have been tested both with pi-topOS and Raspbian Jessie.


Installing the software
#######################

Open a terminal and type the following:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install cups
sudo usermod -a -G lpadmin pi

The last command puts the user pi in the list of
administrators for printers

Now open a web browser. In our tests, Chromium was
unable or much too slow for this task. Therefore,
we recommend to use

Menu->Internet->Web Browser

Type the following address in the address field
of the web browser

localhost:631

You should now get a screen to install and configure
your printer. Select the Administration tab and then
"add printer". Follow the instructions, select your
printer and a driver for your printer or a generic
driver for the type of your printer.Set all options
to default.

Using the printer
*****************

You should now be able to use your printer in
Text Editor and LibreOffice.

There seems to be a nasty little bug in CUPS in the newest version of Raspbian Jessie (not pi-top).
If you get a red ERROR during bootup messages, do the following:

open a terminal and type
systemctl status systemd.modules.load.service

If the message reads
Loaded: loaded (..)
Active: failed

proceed as follows (thanks to Rive on raspberrypi.org/forums)

open a terminal and type
sudo nano /etc/modules-load.d/cups-filters.conf

comment all out, so that every line starts with a #, especially
#lp
#ppdev
#partport_pc

save with ctr-o and quit the nano editor with ctrl-x. Then reboot your rpi. The error message should be gone.
