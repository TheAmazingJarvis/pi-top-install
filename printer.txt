Setting up a printer in pi-topOS and Raspbian Jessie
####################################################

The following instructions have been tested both with pi-topOS and Raspbian Jessie.


Installing the software
#######################

Open a terminal and type the following:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install cups
sudo usermod -a -G lpadmin pi

The last command puts the user pi in the list of administrators for printers

Now open a web browser. In our tests, Chromium was unable or much too slow for this task. Therefore, we recommend to use

Menu->Internet->Web Browser

Type the following address in the address field of the web browser

localhost:631

You should now get a screen to install and configure your printer. Select the Administration tab and then "add printer".
Follow the instructions, select your printer and a driver for your printer or a generic driver for the type of your printer.
Set all options to default.

Using the printer
*****************

You should now be able to use your printer in Text Editor and LibreOffice.
