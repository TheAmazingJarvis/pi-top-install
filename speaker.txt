
Setting up the pi-top speaker in pi-topOS and Raspbian Jessie

First step, (thanks to Rene Richarz) is to look at the config file using

	sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Uncomment #hdmi_drive=2. ie remove the #
	  # Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
Uncomment #dtparam=audio=on 

Then save the file, (Ctrl x) and close the editor

The installation instructions that come with the pi-top speaker recommend the following two steps.
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install -y pt-speaker
This works well with pi-topOS and you should have working spound. If you are using Raspbian Jessie then you will almost certainly be greated with the response:
	"Unable to locate package pt-speaker"

Second step for Raspbian Jessie users, which worked for me with my Pi3 and a number of other people who posted to this forum. [Thanks to John.newman80 who provided a link to the following website

http://www.rs-online.com/designspark/electronics/eng/blog/lorawan-enabling-the-pi-top ]. Do visit the website as the following instructions have been drawn from there.  

Navigate to /etc/apt/sources.list.d, by typing
 
	cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d

make a new file named pi-top.list :
	sudo nano pi-top.list

add the following line:

	deb http://apt.pi-top.com/raspbian/ jessie main

save the file and close the editor and get the required public key:

 	wget http://apt.pi-top.com/apt.pi-top.com.gpg.key

Add the key to the APT keyring

 	sudo apt-key add apt.pi-top.com.gpg.key

Ensure the Pi is up to date:

 	sudo apt-get update

 	sudo apt-get upgrade

install the pi-top specific package pt-speaker

	sudo apt-get install -y pt-speaker
	
[Note added by rricharz: Do not install pt-hub-controller in Raspbian, it is not fully compatible]

Reboot and then the pi-top speaker should be working.

Try out the sound using omxplayer as follows:
 omxplayer -o hdmi filename
 where filename is the name of the file to play.
 
The sound level can be adjusted using the + and - keys.
In gui video players like utube, sound levels can be adjusted with the system sound menu
